# ML Model to Classify Facebook Seller


This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* re
* datetime
* nltk
* sklearn
* xgboost (http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)
  
I also recommend running the code on iPython Notebook (https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#new-to-python-and-jupyter)

## Objective

Using 'Data&Data Classification Challenge - Facebook - Training Set.csv', build a machine learning model that can classify Facebook sales posts to Fake Seller, No Seller, and Seller.

## Data Preprocessing

Meta features:
* 

## Models:

* Random Forest
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting with Decision Tree Regressor
* eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Although all 4 of then are very close to one another in terms of accuracy, XGBoost had the best performance, both accuracy and run-time wise.
